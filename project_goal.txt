Goal of the project. Extend to support a broader range of polyomino-based games. 
For example, Isle of Cats (implemented in a hacky way in separate file)

The game implementation should be modular and allow something along the lines of the following:
    
    0. Candidate set of pieces in the game
        E.g. One set of pentominoes and 12 pre-specified hexominoes
    1. How players get their pieces:
        E.g. Draft from a pool, simultaneous draw, as resources obtained when playing on the map
    2. Which moves are legal? 
        E.g. Place anywhere, adjacent to existing piece, on top of existing pieces etc.
        The board could be a shared board between the players, or individual player boards (as in many Eurogames)
    3. How does the game end?
        E.g. 5 rounds of drafting 8 pieces in each
    4. How does a player win?
        E.g. Blokus - points for the sizes of pieces placed during the game;
             Isle of Cats - points for creating 'families' of multiple cats

Example games to be supported by V1:
    
    1. Cartographers [implemented using Flask/Python]
    2. BÃ¤renpark [mostly implemented using hacky Python]
    3. Llamaland
    4. Isle of Cats [mostly implemented using hacky Python]
    5. Polyssimo Challenge [implemented here using Pygame]
    6. Kingdomino
    7. Tetris go
    8. Patchwork
    9. My City
    10. Project L
    11. Copenhagen
    12. Helsinki
    13. Blokus
    14. FITS

(V2 extension: Support hexagonal grids)

Many of the games have high/very high branching factor for each move (1000s).
